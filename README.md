# School_District_Analysis
Assist Maria with school district trends using Python 3.7.13

# Summary
 In this module we looked to assist Maria in analyzing data for a school district and to see if there were any large trends
that could be determined between public and charter schools and to see how their budget may have effected
test scores. 
  Based off of the findings through out this module public schools on average had a slightly larger budget
with their test scores remaining roughly the same throughout all 4 years.
Charter schools had a lower average budget, with their test scores starting higher and then decreasing over
4 years. 
  This will lead to ask questions about why this is and we can use different data parameters to rerun this 
analysis to dive deeper into why the budget may have had different effects on supplies, teachers, etc.
